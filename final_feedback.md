Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Majd, thank you for your engagement and questions this semester.  In our first interaction, I remember that you pushed back on some core programming concepts, but I've seen your position change during the semester.  Nice work on this final.

With the conversion of state abbreviations to names, it might have been good to find a reference for that or document it as a mapping that you would use.  If your data changed order next time you used this code, that could cause a challenge.

One tip on plotting bar charts -- too much color for the sake of color tends to be a distraction.  In your bar chart by state, the colors don't hold any significance.  Another tip on bar charts, it can often be helpful to sort the data based on the values rather than alphabetically by state name.  That helps show the relative value of the next closest states.  Your chart was an important place to start though.  Nice work.

Your huge pie chart with all 100 states is a bit hard to get any meaning out of.  Generally pie charts aren't that useful, so I was struggling to see your purpose in including them.

The scatter charts are starting to show some interesting correlations, now, though plotting total population versus a partial population will always show some amount of correlation.  "If there are more people.... then there are more people with X."  It would have been good to plot a "% of obese people" rather than the "count of obese people".
