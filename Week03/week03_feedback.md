Part 1:  5/5

Part 2:  4.5/5

14.4 - One nuance here.  Your code assumes that the diagnosis code is either None, CHF, or COPD.  In the even that the score <= 10 and the diagnosis code is something else, your code would not have returned anything.  Also, you could have reused your LACE function here rather than copying and pasting all the code.  -0.5


Nice work throughout.
